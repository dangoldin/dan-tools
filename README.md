# Dan's Tools

This is my attempt at rewriting my old jQuery utilities, currently at [http://dangoldin.com/js-tools/](http://dangoldin.com/js-tools/), in React and Electron.

To run, clone it and change into the folder, run `npm install` and then run the following in two seperate tabs:
```
npm run-script watch
npm start
```

Note that most of the setup was based on the post at [https://medium.com/@Agro/developing-desktop-applications-with-electron-and-react-40d117d97564#.vo3ntk7ms](https://medium.com/@Agro/developing-desktop-applications-with-electron-and-react-40d117d97564#.vo3ntk7ms) but updated to work with the latest versions of React and Electron.
